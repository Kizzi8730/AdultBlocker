# Domain Presets

You can add a starter list of domains by creating `adult_domains.txt` in this folder.
- Put one domain per line (e.g., `example.com`).
- Lines starting with `#` are comments.
- The app will use this list on first run (before any `state.json` exists).

Note: We don’t ship any domain list by default to avoid embedding sensitive content.
Use your own curated list that reflects your choices and values.
